# TriForge Execution State

**Purpose:** current operational state only — not a diary. Reconstructed from Git
and GitHub at the start of every loop; this file records the conclusion, not the
history. See `TRIFORGE_AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_CHARTER.md` §6 (mandate `instrucciones.md` §6.1).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29 (Loop 18 — A5.10 blocked / A5 closed, on branch `docs/a5-10-real-pilot-blocked`)

## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last closed milestone | A5.9 — Writable E2E (mock-first) = **FUNCTIONAL MVP** (`b041a12`, PR #50; ADR 0044) |
| Active milestone | **A5.10 — real provider pilot: BLOCKED (documented)** → **A5 functionally COMPLETE**. Next: A6 routing. |
| `main` SHA | `b041a12` |
| Last `main` CI | `Validate` ✅ success (`b041a12`) |
| Open PRs | A5.10 docs (this branch). NOTE: pre-existing PR #26 "ingest Code Graph context pack" is legacy 1.x, out of the A1–A9 roadmap, not blocking — still to be classified in a low-priority loop. |
| Blockers | none (A5.10 real pilot blocked-and-documented, does NOT block A6–A9) |
| Pending decisions | none |
| Next loop | **A6.1 — Task Profiler** (structured classification: task kind, complexity, risk, blast radius, language, framework, reasoning depth, repetitive work, test burden, security sensitivity, behavioral preservation, migration impact, context size, required provider capabilities; profile validated/auditable/versioned/reproducible/overrideable — A1 `TaskProfile` contract exists). Then A6.2 static router, A6.3 quota-aware, A6.4 metrics, A6.5 repo profiles, A6.6 adaptive. |

## Follow-ups / tech debt

- **TD-1 — RESOLVED** (`9d1dca2`, PR #40): `Clock`/`ManualClock` extracted to the
  neutral `apps/api/src/providers/clock.ts`; all importers (mock/quota/real + tests)
  re-pointed. Product code no longer depends on the `mock/` tree.
- **TD-2 — RESOLVED** (`afc3607`, PR #41): `request_rejected` added to the A1 error
  taxonomy (additive → contract `1.1.0`); the three A3 adapter refusals re-pointed off
  `provider_unavailable`.
- **TD-3 (new, from A5.1 review — deferred to A5.2/A5.3):** the worktree manager
  applies only a baseline path containment for its OWN state paths. The full
  allowed-path policy (block every worktree's `.git`/`.git/objects`, sibling
  worktrees, the state root, `$HOME`, `/mnt/c`; full normalize→realpath→containment→
  symlink/hardlink/TOCTOU on owner read/write paths) is A5.2/A5.3. `.gitattributes`
  smudge-filter neutralization on managed checkout is A5.4.

## Autonomy rule (Charter §2 / §3.2 correction, 2026-06-29)

> A pending **external** action that does not technically block the next milestone
> does **not** halt the autonomous loop. Register the risk, isolate the affected
> action, continue with safe work; stop only on a real hard stop; persist state
> before the context/session limit. (Triggered by the R-SEC-2 PAT-rotation pause,
> which was a compliance defect: PAT rotation is the owner's external action and
> does not block A2 — Git auth via GCM is unaffected. R-SEC-2 stays open as an
> external pending risk; the loop continues.)

- A6 Routing and learning — **active / next** (A6.1 Task Profiler)
- A7 Competitive mode — pending (not required for MVP)
- A8 Product interface — pending
- A9 Hardening and release — pending

## UNKNOWN

- Whether Node/pnpm/Git/Codex CLI/Claude Code are installed and authenticated
  inside the Ubuntu WSL2 distro (distro not started; A0.4 spec §5).
- The concrete OS-isolation mechanism for untrusted provider/repo code on WSL2
  (requirement recorded; design deferred to A4/A5; threat-model §14, RR-4).

## REQUIRES_VERIFICATION

- **A5.10 real writable pilot (BLOCKED).** Safe probe (2026-06-29, no creds read):
  `codex-cli 0.101.0` + `claude` present on the *Windows host*, but the WSL2 Ubuntu
  substrate is **Stopped**, provider **auth is UNKNOWN** (not probed — would risk
  credential interaction), and the A3 adapter is **read-only** (no writable provider
  adapter). To unblock: start WSL2 + install the toolchain there (A0.4 §5), manually
  authenticate the CLIs (owner action), observe+snapshot the *writable* capability,
  then build a separately-bound writable provider adapter. Until then the pilot stays
  blocked; the MVP stands via the mock owner (A5.9).
- Provider event/usage/quota schemas against installed CLI versions (Vision §12,
  §17; quota spec assumptions, 2026-06-28).
- `localhost` Windows↔WSL2 interop per machine/config (A0.4 spec §8.6).
- Codex `--sandbox` runtime behavior against the installed version (A0.4 spec §8.8;
  threat-model T-CMP-01/02).
- Branch-protection enabled-state and required-check name (asserted in docs only;
  threat-model T-INT-08, R-SEC-7).
- pnpm 11 default dependency-build-script blocking without an `.npmrc`
  (threat-model T-GIT-05/08, R-SEC-10).

## Exact next loop

```text
Loop 19 — A6.1 Task Profiler (mandate §A6.1). Branch off main AFTER the A5.10 docs
merge. Implement structured task classification producing the A1 TaskProfile contract
(already in @triforge/shared: taskKind, complexity, risk, blastRadius,
reasoningDepthRequired, repetitiveWorkRatio, testBurden, behavioralPreservationRequired)
plus the richer mandate fields (language, framework, security sensitivity, migration
impact, context size, required provider capabilities). The profile must be validated,
auditable, versioned, reproducible and OVERRIDEABLE (an explicit override wins, audited).
  Tests: deterministic classification from a TaskSpecification; validation rejects an
  out-of-range profile; an override is applied + audited; the profile is reproducible
  (same input → same output) and versioned.
Loop shape unchanged: spec/impl → gates → adversarial review → repair → PR → CI →
squash-merge → verify main → persist this file.
Then A6.2 static capability router (explicit evidence-based rules, no eternal
stereotypes), A6.3 quota-aware router, A6.4 execution metrics, A6.5 repo profiles, A6.6
protected adaptive router. Then A7 competitive, A8 UI, A9 hardening + release.
