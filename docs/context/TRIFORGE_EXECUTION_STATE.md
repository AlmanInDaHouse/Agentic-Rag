# TriForge Execution State

**Purpose:** current operational state only — not a diary. Reconstructed from Git
and GitHub at the start of every loop; this file records the conclusion, not the
history. See `TRIFORGE_AUTONOMOUS_LOOP_CHARTER.md` §6 (mandate `instrucciones.md` §6.1).

**Last updated:** 2026-06-29 (Loop 20 — A6.2, on branch `feat/a6-2-static-router`)

## Snapshot

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Last closed milestone | A6.1 — Task Profiler (`dd2894e`, PR #52; ADR 0045) |
| Active milestone | **A6.2 — Static capability router** (this PR; `orchestration/staticRouter.ts`; ADR 0046) |
| `main` SHA | `dd2894e` |
| Last `main` CI | `Validate` ✅ success (`dd2894e`) |
| Open PRs | A6.2 (this branch). NOTE: pre-existing PR #26 "ingest Code Graph context pack" is legacy 1.x, out of the A1–A9 roadmap, not blocking — still to be classified in a low-priority loop. |
| Blockers | none |
| Pending decisions | none |
| Next loop | **A6.3 — Quota-aware router** (combine A6.2 capability scores + provider availability + auth state + quota + reservations + task risk + historical repo performance + confidence; degradation rules by risk: low=fallback allowed, medium=visible degraded, high=reinforced control, critical=pause/reject; quota unknown ≠ available; quota exhausted = hard stop; NO paid fallback. Extends/wires the A4 `orchestration/routing.ts` + A2.3 quota manager). Then A6.4 metrics, A6.5 repo profiles, A6.6 adaptive. |

## Follow-ups / tech debt

- **TD-1 — RESOLVED** (`9d1dca2`, PR #40): `Clock`/`ManualClock` extracted to the
  neutral `apps/api/src/providers/clock.ts`; all importers (mock/quota/real + tests)
  re-pointed. Product code no longer depends on the `mock/` tree.
- **TD-2 — RESOLVED** (`afc3607`, PR #41): `request_rejected` added to the A1 error
  taxonomy (additive → contract `1.1.0`); the three A3 adapter refusals re-pointed off
  `provider_unavailable`.
- **TD-3 (new, from A5.1 review — deferred to A5.2/A5.3):** the worktree manager
  applies only a baseline path containment for its OWN state paths. The full
  allowed-path policy (block every worktree's `.git`/`.git/objects`, sibling
  worktrees, the state root, `$HOME`, `/mnt/c`; full normalize→realpath→containment→
  symlink/hardlink/TOCTOU on owner read/write paths) is A5.2/A5.3. `.gitattributes`
  smudge-filter neutralization on managed checkout is A5.4.

## Autonomy rule (Charter §2 / §3.2 correction, 2026-06-29)

> A pending **external** action that does not technically block the next milestone
> does **not** halt the autonomous loop. Register the risk, isolate the affected
> action, continue with safe work; stop only on a real hard stop; persist state
> before the context/session limit. (Triggered by the R-SEC-2 PAT-rotation pause,
> which was a compliance defect: PAT rotation is the owner's external action and
> does not block A2 — Git auth via GCM is unaffected. R-SEC-2 stays open as an
> external pending risk; the loop continues.)

## UNKNOWN

- Whether Node/pnpm/Git/Codex CLI/Claude Code are installed and authenticated
  inside the Ubuntu WSL2 distro (distro not started; A0.4 spec §5).
- The concrete OS-isolation mechanism for untrusted provider/repo code on WSL2
  (requirement recorded; design deferred to A4/A5; threat-model §14, RR-4).

## REQUIRES_VERIFICATION

- **A5.10 real writable pilot (BLOCKED).** Safe probe (2026-06-29, no creds read):
  `codex-cli 0.101.0` + `claude` present on the *Windows host*, but the WSL2 Ubuntu
  substrate is **Stopped**, provider **auth is UNKNOWN** (not probed — would risk
  credential interaction), and the A3 adapter is **read-only** (no writable provider
  adapter). To unblock: start WSL2 + install the toolchain there (A0.4 §5), manually
  authenticate the CLIs (owner action), observe+snapshot the *writable* capability,
  then build a separately-bound writable provider adapter. Until then the pilot stays
  blocked; the MVP stands via the mock owner (A5.9).
- Provider event/usage/quota schemas against installed CLI versions (Vision §12,
  §17; quota spec assumptions, 2026-06-28).
- `localhost` Windows↔WSL2 interop per machine/config (A0.4 spec §8.6).
- Codex `--sandbox` runtime behavior against the installed version (A0.4 spec §8.8;
  threat-model T-CMP-01/02).
- Branch-protection enabled-state and required-check name (asserted in docs only;
  threat-model T-INT-08, R-SEC-7).
- pnpm 11 default dependency-build-script blocking without an `.npmrc`
  (threat-model T-GIT-05/08, R-SEC-10).

## Exact next loop

```text
Loop 21 — A6.3 Quota-aware router (mandate §A6.3). Branch off main AFTER A6.2 merges.
Combine: A6.2 capability scores + provider availability + auth state + quota +
reservations + task risk + historical repo performance + confidence → a final routing
recommendation, wiring the A4 orchestration/routing.ts owner-selection (which already
does quota-gated degradation) with the A2.3 quota manager. Degradation rules:
  low risk = fallback allowed under policy; medium = degraded state VISIBLE; high =
  reinforced control; critical = pause/reject; quota UNKNOWN ≠ available (don't present
  as guaranteed); quota EXHAUSTED = hard stop; NO paid fallback.
  Tests: capability+quota produce the expected owner; unknown quota is not treated as
  available; exhausted quota hard-stops; high/critical degradation gated; deterministic.
Loop shape unchanged. Then A6.4 execution metrics (protected against duplication/
cross-run contamination/self-reporting/missing-samples/cherry-picking), A6.5 repository
profiles (no auto-generalization), A6.6 protected adaptive router (min sample +
confidence + fallback + human override + explainable + security/correctness priority).
Then A7 competitive, A8 UI, A9 hardening + release.
```
